# Data Science Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of my Data Science studies and ongoing independent practice.

The notebooks are used to explore, implement, and reflect on concepts introduced throughout my coursework, with a focus on understanding underlying ideas rather than producing polished or optimized solutions.

---

## Purpose of this repository

The primary purpose of this repository is learning and consolidation.

The notebooks serve as a working space to:

- Translate theoretical concepts into executable code

- Experiment with different approaches and assumptions

- Build intuition around data, models, and systems

- Revisit and refine earlier work as new concepts are introduced

- They are intentionally iterative and may evolve as my studies progress.

---

## Scope and themes

The repository covers — and will continue to expand across — multiple areas within Data Science, including:

### Statistics and probability
Used to explore and compare different statistical concepts as they are introduced in coursework, focusing on interpretation, assumptions, and practical implications rather than on a fixed set of formulas.

### Data exploration and analysis
Working with structured data, exploring distributions, relationships, and summary measures to support reasoning and decision-making.

### Programming fundamentals for data work
Emphasis on clear logic, readable code, and step-by-step implementations in Python.

### Big Data and distributed computing
Notebooks using Apache Spark to explore large-scale data processing concepts, with planned expansion into topics related to Big Data systems and Cloud computing.

*Additional themes will be added as new courses and projects are undertaken.*

## Structure and approach

- Notebooks are organized by topic or course rather than by finished projects

- Code prioritizes clarity and correctness over performance

- oncepts are often implemented manually before introducing library abstractions

- Notes and comments focus on reasoning and interpretation

- This repository is meant to reflect an active learning process, not a finalized body of work.

---

## Intended audience

This repository is primarily intended for:

- Personal learning and revision

- Lecturers or reviewers interested in my problem-solving approach

- Recruiters who want to see how I reason about data-related concepts

- It is not designed as a tutorial series or production-ready codebase.

---

## Tools and technologies

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- NumPy and related scientific libraries

- Apache Spark (PySpark)

- The tooling is kept minimal where possible to avoid obscuring core ideas.

---

## Notes

Some notebooks may:

- Contain exploratory or intermediate work

- Be revisited and extended over time

- Reflect different stages of understanding of the same concept
